# Create a function word_frequencies that takes
# a string filename as a parameter and returns a
# dictionary mapping each word in the text file
# to the total number of times it occurs. All
# letters should be treated as lower case, and both
# punctuation and numbers should be ignored.
# Letters separated by apostrophes should be left together.
# Your solution may use string & file functions.
# Hint: see https://www.techiedelight.com/remove-punctuations-string-python/
